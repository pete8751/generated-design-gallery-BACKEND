# generated-design-gallery-BACKEND

This repo contains the server files for my generated-design-gallery project. 
Through this backend I communicate with the database to serve images, and to record users' likes and carted images. Additionally I have implemented a sort function in the Frontend which requires this backend to 
sort through images as per the users' choosing. I tested this server using Postman, and have gained experience with RESTful APIs through this project. I would like to implement a use case allowing users to randomly generate art
through an API call in this server.

Please note that since the Backend is hosted on a free hosting service (Render), there is a windup time of up to 30 seconds, after which the website will begin communicating with the server and database at normal speeds. (This may be evident at first in the search section of the website)

I am currently complete with the main functionality of this backend, but I still would like to clean it up and optimize it, and am looking to implement a new API call when I update the frontend to include the user generated art use-case.
